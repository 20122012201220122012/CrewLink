# Pre-Flight Checklist
Please use this checklist to avoid spamming:

1. [ ] I am not asking a question => goto the Discord if you are [discord](https://discord.gg/9mwuVNA)
2. [ ] I am using the Steam version of Among Us
3. [ ] I have tried to use an [alternative server](https://status.crewl.ink/)
4. [ ] I have checked everyone in my lobby is on the same CrewLink server
5. [ ] I have used `Ctrl+r` on the CrewLink app when I can't hear some people (this is a known issue)
6. [ ] I have checked the CrewLink server I'm using is up to date
7. [ ] I have a screenshot of any errors
8. [ ] I checked someone else has not reported this. Meaning the devs don't have to deal with duplicates and have more time to add cool stuff
